            <p id="firstp">My name is Nestor Ramirez, I am a proactive person that likes challenges. I enjoy cultural diversity and I am always facinated by the weird and the strange. I enjoy to travel to fullfill this desire, the more different to my culture people are the more I like them. I am very open minded and like to learn. </p>
        
            <p id="firstp">My hobbies are everything that I can do with my family or for my family; cooking and coffee are some of my top hobbies. I enjoy bike riding, running, music and any social events. I have a very young soul and love the challenge. <strong>Any Challenge.</strong> I feel I can still give a lot of positive to this world, I have not done enough to save it. </p>
        
            <p id="firstp">I am strong believer of the "green house effect" and a follower of Al Gore. One of my goals in life is make a positive impact in others, as Al Gore has been for me. The earth is our house and at the end, it is our only home and we have to take care of our home.</p>
